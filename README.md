## Introduction

Construct-Assist is a web application that was developed to ease the acquisition of reliable construction professionals and service providers in Kenya. In Kenya, a major problem facing the construction industry is the scarcity of skilled and reliable professionals and service providers within the field. As a result of this, whenever foreign labour is unavailable, unskilled labour is often relied upon resulting in issues such as poor quality construction work and on the extreme end fatalities within the construction sites.

Construct-Assist provides project managers with a tools that allows them to review the services of the professionals or service providers that they worked with using English/Swahili or a mix of both languages. The system utilizes a sentiment analysis model in the backend to classify the reviews and thus classify professionals or service providers that are reliable or unreliable. Only those that are classified as reliable shall appear to project managers in recruitment searches.

The web application was developed using CodeIgniter4, the model was trained using Jupyter Notebook and the model API was developed using python and was tested locally using Uvicorn.

### Composer and CodeIgniter4 related dependencies

#### Install Composer:
Composer is a dependency manager for PHP that is required for running CodeIgniter 4. Follow the steps below to install Composer:

Download and install Composer by visiting the Composer download page.

For Windows:

- Download the Composer-Setup.exe file.

For macOS and Linux:

Run the following command in your terminal to download Composer:

```{code}
php -r "copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer', 'composer-setup.php');"
```
- Verify the installerâ€™s integrity:

```{code}
php -r "if (hash_file('sha384', 'composer-setup.php') === 'YOUR_HASH') { echo 'Installer verified'; } else { echo 'Installer corrupt'; unlink('composer-setup.php'); } echo PHP_EOL;"
```

Replace YOUR_HASH with the hash value from the Composer website.

- Install Composer globally:

```{code}
sudo php composer-setup.php --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer
```

- Remove the installer:

```{code}
php -r "unlink('composer-setup.php');"
```

- Verify installation:

```{code}
composer --version
```

#### Install CodeIgniter 4:
- Navigate to the directory where you want to install CodeIgniter 4.

- Use Composer to create a new CodeIgniter 4 project:

```{code}
composer create-project codeigniter4/project_name
```
- Navigate to the project folder:

```{code}
cd project_name
```

Update project dependencies: 

```{code}
composer install --working-dir=requirements\
```
